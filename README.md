# kata-diamond

Inspired by https://github.com/codingdojo-org/codingdojo.org/blob/master/content/kata/Diamond.md

This implementation starts out by only creating the top left half of the diamond, then simply mirrors this to add the top right half. In the final step the top half is mirrored to add the bottom half.
